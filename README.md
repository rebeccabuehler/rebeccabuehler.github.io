# My Portfolio
I am amking this portfolio to share how I have grown and communicate the work I have done. I will be making and adding a video introducing myself, and giving an overview of my skills.
On my landing page I will have a bio, my git username, my linkedIn, and my contact information.
I will provide special links to my git repositories of my three projects.
Three projects will consist of my Pac-Men exercise, the Eyes exercise, and a Real Time Bus Tracker.

I have added a bootstrap style, from here I will adjust it and chnage it to fit my objective of my portfolio.
I plan on adding my viodeo introduction, inbedding links to my repos, and offering information on my skills and contact info.
